      <p>Welcome to LK Hair Creations, a private studio salon owned by Linda K Williamson and located inside Reflections Salon and Spa. With 20 years of experience as a hairstylist, I am committed to providing you with the highest quality and level of professionalism. I am dedicated to giving my guests exceptional service by listening to their wants, concerns and needs.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>Throughout my career I have been extremely fortunate to have had the opportunity to work on several photo shoots, fashion shows, and with a few of Denver’s professional sports dance teams. I provide services for the entire family; however, I specialize in women’s cuts, color, and extensions.
      I pride myself with extensive ongoing education, learning the latest trends, techniques, and products. This gives me the ability to keep you in the most up-to-date styles. Each product that I use and recommend is chosen carefully for its ability to maintain and enhance the health and integrity of your hair while keeping our environment safe.
      </p>

      <br>

      <p>Hair is my passion! There is no greater reward to me than to know I have helped my clients feel their absolute best.
